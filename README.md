# Mixex: A Personal Music Streaming Application ðŸŽ§

Welcome to **Mixex**, a personal music streaming application tailored for a unique listening experience. This project is currently in its initial development phase, with the goal of creating a self-contained and highly customizable music platform.

## Project Vision

The primary purpose of **Mixex** is to provide a personal music library free from advertisements, with a focus on seamless music playback and integrated lyrics. The application is designed to be fully controlled by you, allowing for the direct management of your music files and a highly personalized user interface.

## Core Features

This project aims to deliver the following key functionalities:

* **Playlist Import**: Easily import existing playlists from popular streaming services like YouTube and Spotify.
* **Local File Management**: Add new songs to your library by either importing local files or downloading them directly from YouTube and Spotify using `yt-dlp` and `spotify-dlp`.
* **Advanced Music Curation**: Find and filter your songs using custom tags (e.g., '50s', 'Jazz'). The search functionality will also support filtering by song title or even keywords within the lyrics.
* **Offline Experience**: A cornerstone of the app is its offline capability. You can download songs to your device for listening without an internet connection and even export the files to your phone's storage.
* **AI-Powered Data Enrichment**: When you add a new song, an AI component will automatically search for and populate metadata such as lyrics, release dates, and artists. All AI-generated data will be clearly marked, and users will have the option to edit this information or "sign off" on its accuracy.
* **Customization**: Personalize the app's look and feel, including colors and the layout of certain elements.
* **Background Playback**: The music will continue to play in the background, allowing you to use other applications on your device without interruption.
